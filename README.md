# Monopoly

This project came about because of a simple problem: "It takes too much time and error for the Monopoly game." 

This project is a Monopoly Banker App to be used by the Banker of the game. It is a quick, slick and easy interface in order for the Banker of the game to be as error free and quick as possible.

There is also an Android application that accompanies this program: https://github.com/Ikeysmo/MonopolyApp. I also contribute to this project.
